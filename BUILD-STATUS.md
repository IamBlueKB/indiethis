| `src/components/shared/PWARegister.tsx` | Service worker registration (production only) |
| `public/manifest.json` | PWA web app manifest — name, icons, theme_color, start_url |

| `public/icons/` | PWA icons: `icon-192.png`, `icon-512.png`, `icon-512-maskable.png` (generated from brand icon) |
| `src/app/[slug]/page.tsx` | Artist public page — two-column layout, canvas + lyrics left, content right |
| `src/lib/avatar/styles.ts` | Client-safe `AVATAR_STYLES` export (no server imports) — prevents sharp from bundling into client |

## ARCHITECTURE NOTES

### Auth Pattern
- Auth is handled in `src/proxy.ts`, **NOT** `middleware.ts`
- Any route that needs to skip auth (screenshots, public API, etc.) must be added to `PUBLIC_PATHS` in `proxy.ts` AND have the layout redirect commented out
- `/api/dev` prefix is in PUBLIC_PATHS for email preview routes

### Signup Flow (PendingSignup → User)
1. User fills `/signup` → `POST /api/auth/signup-init` → creates `PendingSignup` record, returns `pendingId`
2. User selects plan on `/pricing` → `POST /api/stripe/checkout` → creates Stripe Checkout session, stores `stripeSessionId` on PendingSignup
3. Stripe payment completes → `checkout.session.completed` webhook → `POST /api/auth/complete-signup` → creates `User` from PendingSignup
4. `agreedToTerms: true` + `agreedToTermsAt` timestamp stored on PendingSignup at step 1

### Audio Player State
- All player state lives in Zustand at `src/store/audio.ts`
- `AudioTrack` type includes: `id`, `title`, `artist`, `src`, `coverArt`, `canvasVideoUrl`, `lyrics`, `description`, `duration`, `previewOnly`
- `HeroCanvasDisplay` and `LyricsDisplay` subscribe to the store — they only activate when a track from the current artist is playing

### Canvas Video on Artist Page
- `HeroCanvasDisplay` checks `artistTrackIds.includes(currentTrack.id)` — only shows for this artist's tracks
- When nothing playing: shows `latestCanvasVideo` (latest track's canvas) or `latestCoverArt` as static fallback
- `fast-average-color` extracts dominant color → radial glow behind panel (transitions 1s ease)
- `AnimatePresence mode="wait"` handles cross-fade on track change — `animate={{ opacity: 0.7 }}` (NOT 1, which overrides the style prop)
- 280px left column on desktop, full-width stacked on mobile

### Lyrics Scroll
- `overflow-y: hidden` + direct `container.scrollTop = (scrollHeight - clientHeight) * (currentTime / duration)`
- Do NOT use `scrollTo` (rapid calls interrupt each other) or `scrollIntoView` (scrolls whole page)

### Canvas Video Opacity Bug (documented)
- Framer Motion `animate={{ opacity: 1 }}` overrides `style.opacity`. Always set the final opacity in `animate`, not `style`, for Framer-controlled elements

### Prisma on Windows Dev
- `prisma generate` requires stopping the dev server first — Next.js holds a DLL lock on the generated client
- Dev server: always start with `preview_start "IndieThis"` (port 3456) — if blocked, delete `.next/dev/lock`

## KNOWN BUGS / ISSUES

| # | File | Issue |
|---|------|-------|
| 1 | ~~`src/lib/stripe.ts:24`~~ | ~~`PLAN_PRICES.reign.amount` still set to `14900` (old $149 price)~~ **FIXED** — updated to `9900` |
| 2 | `AudioFeatures` table | Sparse data — radar filter works but most tracks/beats have no AudioFeatures record; similarity matching returns few results |
| 3 | ~~Stripe everywhere~~ | ~~No `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` in env → all subscription, PPU, invoice, beat purchase flows return 503 in dev~~ **FIXED** — all 6 Stripe env vars set; products + prices created in test mode |
| 4 | ~~`CRON_SECRET` not set~~ | ~~Cron routes have no auth protection in dev~~ **FIXED** — all 5 cron routes validated; `CRON_SECRET` set in `.env` |
| 5 | ~~`YOUTUBE_API_KEY` not set~~ | **FIXED** — key set in `.env.local` |
| 6 | ~~SMS limits hardcoded~~ | ~~SMS limit values are hardcoded per tier, not in PlatformPricing~~ **FIXED** — moved to `PlatformPricing` table; editable from `/admin/settings/pricing` |
| 7 | ~~`STRIPE_PRICE_ID_PUSH_LIFETIME` / `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_REIGN_LIFETIME`~~ | **FIXED** — $0 Stripe prices created, IDs set in `.env.local`, billing + tier-drop logic fully wired |
| 10 | ~~Chromaprint / fpcalc not on Vercel~~ | **FIXED** — SHA-256 fallback replaced with ACRCloud File Scanning API; stores matched title/artist/ISRC/confidence as JSON |
| 11 | ~~`/api/admin/cover-art/styles` Vercel build error~~ | ~~`Type 'null' is not assignable to type 'string \| StringFilter'` on `{ previewUrl: null }` Prisma filter~~ **FIXED** — `previewUrl` is non-nullable String; changed filter to `{ previewUrl: "" }` only |

## KNOWN BUGS / ISSUES

| # | File | Issue |
|---|------|-------|
| 1 | ~~`src/lib/stripe.ts:24`~~ | ~~`PLAN_PRICES.reign.amount` still set to `14900` (old $149 price)~~ **FIXED** — updated to `9900` |
| 2 | `AudioFeatures` table | Sparse data — radar filter works but most tracks/beats have no AudioFeatures record; similarity matching returns few results |
| 3 | ~~Stripe everywhere~~ | ~~No `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` in env → all subscription, PPU, invoice, beat purchase flows return 503 in dev~~ **FIXED** — all 6 Stripe env vars set; products + prices created in test mode |
| 4 | ~~`CRON_SECRET` not set~~ | ~~Cron routes have no auth protection in dev~~ **FIXED** — all 5 cron routes validated; `CRON_SECRET` set in `.env` |
| 5 | ~~`YOUTUBE_API_KEY` not set~~ | **FIXED** — key set in `.env.local` |
| 6 | ~~SMS limits hardcoded~~ | ~~SMS limit values are hardcoded per tier, not in PlatformPricing~~ **FIXED** — moved to `PlatformPricing` table; editable from `/admin/settings/pricing` |
| 7 | ~~`STRIPE_PRICE_ID_PUSH_LIFETIME` / `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_REIGN_LIFETIME`~~ | **FIXED** — $0 Stripe prices created, IDs set in `.env.local`, billing + tier-drop logic fully wired |
| 9 | `AudioFeatures` table | Sparse data — radar filter and similarity matching return few results |
| 10 | ~~Chromaprint / fpcalc not on Vercel~~ | **FIXED** — SHA-256 fallback replaced with ACRCloud File Scanning API; stores matched title/artist/ISRC/confidence as JSON |
